## Takeaways:
This project was my first introdution to building a CRUD app, and I faced many challenges during the development of it. 
I learned a great deal in splitting up a project into specific components, each with their own functionality. This allowed to gain a different perspective 
of the process that goes into building a large scale project. Although this project used pure Vanilla JS, I walked away from this application having understood the fundamentals
of a CRUD app and how to efficiently develop one.
